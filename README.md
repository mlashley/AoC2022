# Advent of Code 2022

Spoilers - I strongly recommend you skip this, and try to learn for yourself.

# Motivation

Done this for a couple of years. For some reason we can no longer just take the challenge on spec...
One year we tried to visualise everything (resulting in some excessive blender gymnastics), this year - I've decided to start in Rust (given zero prior experience).

Come back at the end of Dec to see if I _finish_ in Rust...
